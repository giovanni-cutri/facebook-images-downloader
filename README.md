# facebook-images-downloader
 A tool to download all the images of a Facebook page.

# Getting Started

Requires:
- Python 3, which you can download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), along with the *selenium* library;
- [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver), a Firefox WebDriver (refer to its repository for installation instructions).

Download the file *facebook-downloader.py* from this repository.

# Usage

Open the command prompt from the folder where *facebook-downloader.py* is located and run the following command:

````
python facebook-downloader.py [URL]
````

replacing [URL] with the URL of the Facebook page of which you want to download the images.

The script will create a *facebook* folder and a subfolder with the same name of the page, where the images will be saved.
